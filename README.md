#### Usage

During the installation process of WPN-XM the webinterface is installed to `/server/www/tools/webinterface`.

By default the webinterface is served by Nginx, but it may also be served by the embedded PHP server.

##### Webinterface served by Nginx

You might reach the webinterface via the URL `http://localhost/tools/webinterface/index.php`

Hint: The webinterface will automatically open up in your browser, when the stack is started with `start-wpnxm.bat`.

##### Webinterface served by embedded PHP server

When using the embedded PHP server to serve the webinterface, it might be used as a control center application for the server stack.

To start it, launch the following command on CLI: `C:\server\bin\php\php -S localhost:90 -t C:\server\www`.

Or simply use `start-scp-server.bat`.

You might reach the webinterface via the URL `http://localhost:90/tools/webinterface/index.php`

#### Development

**Debug Page**

The webinterface has a debug screen showing Constants and their values.
It might be helpful, when working with Paths.

`http://localhost/tools/webinterface/index.php?page=debug`
